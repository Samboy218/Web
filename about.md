I currently attend Tennessee Technological University studying Computer science with a concentration in Cyber Security. 
I'm in my senior year, and I'll also be pursuing my masters as well.

I'm one of Tennessee's first SFS Cybercorp scholars, more information about that program [Here][sfs-link], and if you're interested in 
joining or learning more feel free to contact me.

I greatly enjoy programming, more for the fun of doing complex things and learning than anything else. 
C++ is my favorite language to code in; while some see it as overly pedantic and frustrating to use (and sometimes it is), 
I love the flexibility and precise control it gives me over my programs. 
In contrast, my second favorite language is python, for basically the opposite reasons I like C++. I enjoy the high levels of abstraction and 
quick, dirty programming style it offers. If I need to do something quick and I'm not concerned about high sophistication or performace, I'll use python. 

I also enjoy hardware level things. All through high school I spent a ton of my free time with a soldering iron in my hand. 
I'm by no means an expert, and I don't consider myself to have a highly proficient knowledge of circuits and electricity, but I still enjoy making circuits.

I also do other things in my free time, mainly I play PC games (right now I'm on a Mount & Blade kick), and I'm also an avid player of Magic: The Gathering.
